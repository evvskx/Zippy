# ðŸš€ Zippy

A hassle-free way to download multiple OS ISOs

## ðŸ”§ How to run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evvskx/Zippy.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd Zippy
npm install
```

### 3. Start Zippy

```bash
npm start
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* Zippy is still **Work In Progress**: some features may not be fully implemented.
* I do not plan on adding MacOS' ISOs since it requires certain tools that are only available for Mac themselves. I will not use any link regarding archives ecc. unless valid checksums are given.
